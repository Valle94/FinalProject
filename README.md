Unity 3D Final Project for CITA 312

This game was designed to be a physics based racing game that utilizes 3D space, inspired by the racing classic, Trackmania. 

Unfinished features: The list of things I didn't get to is very long, but the main highlight is that my original goal was to implemeny Unity's MLAgents to train a neural network to play the game. This would have led to the ability to have vs. races instead of just the time trial style I have. 

Additionally, I would consider adding true multiplayer, as well as a bunch of smaller improvements, such as adding a more robust UI and menu system, and adding car customization. There's a ton of physics variables in the Unity editor, so it would be cool if in a more campaign style game mode if you could earn money and upgrade your car. I would also spend more time in Blender refining the race track pieces, both visually and mechanically. Adding the transforms in Blender and then importing to Unity would save a lot of hassle and bad track piece joints.
